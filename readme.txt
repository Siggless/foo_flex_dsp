HISTORY and CREDITS:

v2.1.1
Quick fix for foobar2000 1.6 where dsp configurations did not show up. Limitation: You can not call this DSP from context menu "View" > "DSP" > "Dynamic DSP". Instead use the preference dialog only.

v2.1:
Updated by "Mario66" in 2018. License changed to MIT. Added option to make the DSP dependent on the output device through new variables.

v2:
Modified by hydrogenaud.io user "Mario66" in 2015 without changing the license. Minor GUI tweaks, support for evaluation to multiple chains, added ReplayGain scanner mode with DSP enabled.
ReplayGain scanner GUI is based on R128Scan by hydrogenaud.io user "kode54" <https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php/topic,86404.0.html>.

v1:
Originally written by hydrogenaud.io user "popatr" in 2012 with the following license notice:
"I make no restrictions on what you can do with the the source code or component."
